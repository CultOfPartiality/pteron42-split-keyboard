# Pteron36 Split Keyboard
## Intro 
![Pteron36 PCB Render](https://github.com/harshitgoel96/pteron36-split-keyboard/blob/main/images/pteron36-split.svg)
This project is the split evolution of the [pteron-pcb](https://github.com/Kraken-Jokes/pteron-pcb) project, which itself is the evolution of the [Pteron-Keyboard](github.com/FSund/pteron-keyboard) project, an incredible ergonomic keyboard that was handwired only.

The keyboard is being desinged to be used with [Miryoku-layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), this layout out aims to have efficient use of split keyboard.

## Important
The keyboard and case files are currently untested. I do not have a timeline for testing at this moment.
