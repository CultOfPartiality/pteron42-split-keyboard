## Intro 
![Pteron56v0.1 finished](https://github.com/Kraken-Jokes/pteron-pcb/blob/main/images/Pteron56PCBv0.1%20build.jpg)
This project is the evolution of the [Pteron-Keyboard](github.com/FSund/pteron-keyboard) project, an incredible ergonomic keyboard that was handwired only.

I aimed to increase the appeal of this board by designing a PCB for it, and through the next months learned how to design one.

Since the case design had to be modified to fit a PCB, it was decided that this would live in a separate repository to make it easier to navigate the files and make sure that the compatible files for either version aren't mixed.

## Case Assembly
![PCB Case](https://github.com/Kraken-Jokes/pteron-pcb/blob/main/images/Pteron56PCBv0.1%20case.png)
Starting out, the case is made of stacked acrylic plates. I might look into a molded or cast case at some point, but my focus is not on that at the moment.\
Each case has 4 plates and multiple m2 hardware pieces. This creates a case with an overall height of ~16mm. You can likely only use a single 1/4" stack plate, you would just need to use 5mm or 6mm m2 standoffs instead (haven't done it though so idk)

Qty  | Item
-----|------
1x | base (1/8")
1x | plate(1/8")
2x | stack plate (1/4")
8x | 2mm x 5mm M2 spacer
10x | 12mm M2 x 3mm standoffs
8x | 6mm M2 x 3mm standoffs
28x | 5mm M2 screws
8x | 10mm M2 screws

**Don't do the case assembly until you've soldered on diodes and the Pro Micro to the PCB**\
To start, take the base and place a 5mm M2 screw and thread a 12mm M2 spacer on to each perimeter hole.\
Take the stack plates and set them onto the base. They should slide on no problem but may need to be pushed down gently. Get all the standoffs alligned before giving it the oomph though.\
Now we're gonna grab the switch plate and PCB. Take the 10mm screws and set them through the 8 inner holes on the PCB. Somehow, flip the PCB over so the screws are sticking up.\
Set a 2mm tall m2 spacer over each screw then place the PCB on top.\
Take a 6mm M2 spacer and thread it on, locking the PCB in place.\
Overturn the plate/PCB assemby onto the case assembly, and install the 10 perimeter 5mm M2 screws on the top. Flip it over, install 8 inner 5mm M2 screws.

have fun!
