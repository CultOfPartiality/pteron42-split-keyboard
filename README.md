# Pteron36 Split Keyboard
## Intro 
![Pteron36 PCB Render](https://github.com/harshitgoel96/pteron36-split-keyboard/blob/main/images/pteron36-split.svg)   


This project is the split evolution of the [pteron-pcb](https://github.com/Kraken-Jokes/pteron-pcb) project, which itself is the evolution of the [Pteron-Keyboard](https://github.com/FSund/pteron-keyboard) project, an incredible ergonomic keyboard that was handwired only.

The keyboard is being desinged to be used with [Miryoku-layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), this layout out aims to have efficient use of split keyboard.

NOTE: The keyboard design has reached its goal, I will not be doing any more development on this board. The support will still be provided. Any issues found by community will be addressed.

## Built keyboard
![Pteron36 keyboard](https://github.com/harshitgoel96/pteron36-split-keyboard/blob/main/images/built.jpeg)

## Build guide
Build guide is added in BUILD.md file.

## Firmware file
Pteron36 has been merged into QMK master with support for miryoku and via. VIA config in available in release section.
Pteron36 has been merged into VIAL QMK fork. 

## Important
The PCB and the case have been tested with MX Switches. 

### PCB compatibility matrix
| PCB version | MX Support | Alps Support | Choc support | Remark |
|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| V1.1.0 | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark: | :x: | |
| V1.2.0 | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | |
| V1.3.0 | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Cleaner trace routing, added mounting holes |
| V1.4.0 | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Replaced sharp angle with curves, more cleaner pcb look |
To use choc switches, make sure to use V1.2.0 files from release section.

### Case compatibility

| Case Type | MX Support | Alps Support | Choc support |
|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Acrylic | :heavy_check_mark: |:x: | :exclamation: Untested, plate need to be lasered on 2mm sheet |
| 3D Printed | 	:construction: Design complete, testing first prototypes |:x: | 	:construction: Design complete, testing first prototypes |

Tenting support added, need M4 screws for tenting holes.
### Acrylic Case assembly
Keyboard supports both ProMicro, and nrf52840 based Bluetooth promicro (bluemicro,nice!nano, etc). The case height will be different to accomodate batteries.
The case designed to be done 3mm acrylic.
Screw M2 6mm 36 nos
Standoff HEX M2 6mm or 9mm 18 nos

For tenting you need.
4x M4 25mm-30mm screws.
4x M4 15mm screws.
8x M4 dome nuts for screw bottom.
8x M4 nut for holding case at required height.
#### Case config for ProMicro
All 4 files need to be cut twice so total 8 pieces. 4 per half.
Screw and standoff needs to be M2. Standoff lenght will be 6mm. Screw length will be 5-6mm. 

#### Case config for Bluemicro, Nine!nano
The case will be taller by 3mm to accomodate battery. This is assuming battery battery thickness is between 3mm - 4mm. For thickerbattery add close layer and standoff length as required.
Close.dfx will be cut 4 times, rest all 3 files need to be cut twice so total 10 pieces. 5 per half.
Screw and standoff needs to be M2. Standoff lenght will be 9mm. Screw length will be 5-6mm.



## ToDo List (In order or priority)
* Add build guide. :construction:
* OLED Support in ZMK  :construction:. OLED working in QMK now  :heavy_check_mark: 
* Encoder Support in ZMK  :construction:. Encoder working in QMK now  :heavy_check_mark: 
* Get firmware merged and ZMK.
