This project is the split evolution of the [pteron-pcb](https://github.com/Kraken-Jokes/pteron-pcb) project, which itself is the evolution of the [Pteron-Keyboard](https://github.com/FSund/pteron-keyboard) project, an incredible ergonomic keyboard that was handwired only.

The keyboard is being desinged to be used with [Miryoku-layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), this layout out aims to have efficient use of split keyboard.

## Important
The keyboard and case files are currently being testedS. A small run of 10 PCB has been manufactured, and I am currently in process of testing it. The pcb have passed continuity test, I will be building a prototype keyboard soon.
