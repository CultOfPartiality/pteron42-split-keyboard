This project is the split evolution of the [pteron-pcb](https://github.com/Kraken-Jokes/pteron-pcb) project, which itself is the evolution of the [Pteron-Keyboard](https://github.com/FSund/pteron-keyboard) project, an incredible ergonomic keyboard that was handwired only.

The keyboard is being desinged to be used with [Miryoku-layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), this layout out aims to have efficient use of split keyboard.

## Important
The keyboard and case files are currently being testedS. A small run of 10 PCB has been manufactured, and I am currently in process of testing it. The pcb have passed continuity test, I will be building a prototype keyboard soon.

# Known Issues
The main branch is currenlty not fully working with Kailh Choc V1 switches. The PCB has the holes in correct posistion but they are not wired correctly, only one (Right hand) has the correct wiring, this is fixed in Universal-fix branch, but has not been validated yet. Do Not use the main branch, and V1.1.0 release with Choc switches.
